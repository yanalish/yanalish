Hi! ✨
I’m Yana.

I recently completed my PhD with the Oxford Control Group and moved to sunny California to work as a postdoctoral researcher in the AMBER Lab at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

My research focuses on developing efficient, high-fidelity methods for safe optimization-based control. I also apply these techniques for aerospace systems 🚀, predominately working on safe and optimal spacecraft autonomy.  My academic background is in aerodynamics ✈️ and control 👩‍💻.

You can find my publications here 🛠️:

Most of my repositories are private or confidential, but I’m always happy to discuss the methods and experiments presented in my papers — feel free to reach out.
