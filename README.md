Hi! ✨
I’m Yana.

I recently completed my PhD with the Oxford Control Group and moved to sunny California to work as a postdoctoral researcher in the AMBER Lab 🤖at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

My academic background is in engineering, mainly aerodynamics ✈️ and control 👩‍💻. My research focuses on developing efficient, high-fidelity methods for safe optimization-based control, also with applications in aerospace systems 🚀, particularly safe spacecraft autonomy.  

You can find my publications here 🛠️: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VM4WppgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao

Most of my repositories are private or confidential, but I’m always happy to discuss the methods and experiments presented in my papers! Feel free to reach out.
